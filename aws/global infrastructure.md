Infrastructure like data centers and networking connectivity exist as the foundation of every cloud application

the physical infra makes up the AWS global infra (Availability Zones and Regions)

Regions are geographic locations worldwide where AWS hosts its data centers

Regions are independent from one another. Data is not replicated from one region to another, without a user's explicit consent and authorization
