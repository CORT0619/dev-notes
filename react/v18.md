sometimes you have error inside of your components sometimes it's from malformed api responses, things outside of your control, user generated input and you can defend against that with an error boundary


your app doesn't always need an error boundary

nothing in function components that will allow componentDidCatch, so must use class components

static is an es6 class thing, you typically call that method with the class name.MethodName (call it directly on the class and not an instance of the class)

error boundary can only catch things in components that are rendered inside of it

sometimes people will wrap the app tag in App.jsx with Error Boundary to cover everything

error boundary is the catch of react


Portals and refs
----------------
portals allows you to render to a different place from within a component

a ref says i have this piece of something and i need this same thing back every single time

document. is always slow


Context
-------
app level generalized state, try not to apply this to everything, it's hard to handle where the state came from

have a specific reason to use it

you shouldn't have a default value for your context

BrowserRouter and QueryClientProvider use context under the hood

if there is alot of context in the app, consider using redux or mobx instead


useRef
------
allows you to have a container so you can have the same value between renders

wherever you have the ref it'll store that element (in this case a div) in the renderTarget

ref allows you to grab ahold of specific dom nodes

react can create and destroy a dom element at any time, so the only way to ensure you're getting the dom element you want is with a ref

memo - if you want the same object and don't want it to rerender

don't write everything in memo, don't do performance optimizations until you have a performance problem

if using 3js wrap in memo if not then don't

ref is referring to dom nodes

useReducer
----------
redux is a centralized store for state in react, a central concept in redux is a reducer

reducer is a way of saying I have a function which takes in some state, an action and gives us back a new piece state

useReducer is a replacement for useState, they accomplish the same thing in different ways, if you want to see how your state is changing over time you'll want to use useReducer

hsl (hue, saturation, lightness?) is a way of describing colors like rgb 

when you change state you can test it

most problems come from mismanaged state


useMemo
--------
you're saying this is very expensive, please don't call this on every single rerender unless something i give you in this array changes (array on useMemo)

only use useMemo when needed (only need to cache things that are expensive to compute)

is it expensive for me to derive this state again?

you can tell if it's expensive to compute if you have performance problems (application locking up, etc.)



useCallback
-----------
permutation of useMemo

you can memoize a callback and pass it into a function

the component you're passing it into has to have memo wrapping it

usecallback and usememo together gives you the ability to not need to rerender the component every single time

useLayoutEffect
---------------
an effect happens immediately after a render ends,

allows effect to happen synchronously after the render function ends so there's no delay in the render (animations?)

only useful for measuring somethign that happens in the DOM but can only be measured after it's been rerendered everything else just use useEffect


useId
-----
making a design system and have a fancy input with a label, input

htmlFor matches the label with the input, need some type of identifier that is internally consistent to a component but can be used multiple times and also need it to work for server-side rendering

so if you use useId it will give back a unique identifier that will be consistent within the component and that can be used across multiple renders (id for every instance of a component and is consistent)

there are colons added so that you can't use that id for css selectors

the react docs say to not use useId twice inside of the same react component but instead to concatenate on something to the id you're already getting back

const id = useId();


useImperativeHandle
-------------------
mostly for library authors, want to highlight an input with an error (for a child to expose functionality to a parent)

for a form validation library

useDebugValue
-------------
if you have a custom hook and you want to expose a debug value in teh debug tools, this is mostly for a library author not app authors


useDeferredValue
-----------------

useTransition
-------------

useSyncExternalStore
--------------------
exclusively for libraries, allows things like redux and mobx to create subscriptions internally to react


useInsertionEffect (new to react 18)
------------------
as opposed to layouteffect which happens after a component renders, this happens before a component renders, for css and js libraries like styledcomponents, emotion


tailwind
--------
css modules, plain css imported into individual components
follows the idea of atomic css
